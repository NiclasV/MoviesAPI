### Overview

#### This project is a playground for exploring React, TypeScript, styled-components and data fetching using The Movie Database API. It provides an opportunity to experiment with various aspects of modern web development.


### Technologies Used

**React:** The core framework for building the user interface.
**TypeScript:** Enhances code quality and maintainability with static typing.
**styled-components:** Enables the creation of custom, responsive styled components.
**The Movie Database API:** A source of movie-related data for fetching and displaying information.

### Features

- Data Fetching: Utilizes The Movie Database API to retrieve movie data for display.
- Styled Components: Custom styled-components for creating a unique visual experience.
- Dark/Light Mode: Implements a theme switcher using ThemeProvider to offer a dynamic user experience.

### Getting Started

    Install dependencies using npm install.
    Start the development server with npm start.

### Usage

    Explore different movie data fetched from The Movie Database API.
    Toggle between dark and light themes for a personalized viewing experience.

#### Todo

- Create a global context to store the users preference setting of dark/lightmode, maybe localstorage
- Add more pagination functionality (prev/next + manual page input)
- Add more controls for sorting and listing the movies, add toggle to show tvseries/movies
- Add URLhandler to the use of searchParams to enable url-sharing which presets the initial fetch
